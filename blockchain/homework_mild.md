1. There’s a group of crypto enthusiasts who call themselves “True Bitcoiners” that talk about trust and corruption; an inevitable flaw in humanity and leads to trying to control and mistreat others.
2. They see Bitcoin, blockchain and other crypto technologies as an alternative to corruption that don’t depend on institutions.   They want to change who has power and who doesn’t.  
3.  True Bitcoiners understate the risks of crypto such as wildly fluctuating prices, people losing money, difficulty to understand and difficult to reverse fraudulent transactions.   They also overlook that governments and corporations do have a role in  protecting people’s money such as with insurance for banks or returning money that’s been stolen.
