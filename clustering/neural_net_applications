Conservation Metrics builds neural networks (cluster and classify things like the interconnected structures of the brain) for conservationists.
Cornell University's Elephant Listening Project is using neural networks in hopes of saving forest elephants from poachers (forest elephants live in very dense central African rainforests and are therefore incredibly hard to spot). 
Researchers turned their sound recordings into a spectrogram (picture of the soundwave) and fed those pictures into a neural network to see if it could find locations and counts of birds and elephants.
This work is necessary, ethical and helpful because it saves time and quickly identifies locations of animals/organisms that need protection.
