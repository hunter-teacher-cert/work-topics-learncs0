### Graphics Async HW
#### Find an article or video that shows how 3D graphics are used in movies and in other applications. Based on the article, explain how you would incorporate this information into a lesson for 3D graphics.

1. Archaeologists have discovered the largest cave art in North America carved by Native Americans more than 1000 years ago.   The art is hidden underground so photographers used  3D photogrammetry to create a 3D model of the cave to see if they could  uncover additional images that may go unobserved in the tight spaces. Photogrammetry is used to create 3D models with as much detail as possible by using photographs taken from different angles and measuring one or more points on the object and reconstructing them together using software.

2. On a related note, engineering students at Mercer University created a 3D yearbook for students at the Georgia Academy of the Blind in Macon, Georgia, so students can remember their friends' faces.

3. I would incorporate 3D graphics into a lesson by asking students to create a scale model of an architectural landmark and produce the model with a classroom 3D printer as outlined here.
